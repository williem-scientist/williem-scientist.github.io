## Williem

Hello, I'm Williem, and my journey has been one of passion, dedication, and constant growth. In August 2017, I reached a significant milestone by obtaining my Ph.D. in information and communication engineering from Inha University, Korea. During my Ph.D. years, I delved into cutting-edge research and proudly published papers in esteemed computer vision conferences and journals like CVPR, ICCV, and TPAMI.

My academic achievements didn't stop there; I received numerous outstanding paper awards, a testament to the impact of my research in the field. As I graduated in 2017, I was honored with the Outstanding Research Award, recognizing my contributions during my academic journey.

From September 2017 to August 2020, I embarked on a new chapter as a faculty member at Binus University. It was an immensely fulfilling experience to guide and inspire the next generation of aspiring minds in the realm of computer science.

As my passion for innovation grew, I co-founded Verihubs in June 2019 and embraced the role of CTO & co-founder. For four years, until August 2023, I led a dynamic team, creating innovative solutions and striving to make a difference in the startup ecosystem.

However, my focus has shifted, and I now find myself deeply immersed in a new and exciting chapter. I've chosen to pursue the path of an independent AI researcher in Indonesia, actively contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence. Notably, I am honored to be a founding member of the [Indonesia Vision AI community](https://visionai.id/), where our collective mission is to accelerate the growth of Vision AI in my home country.

I am dedicating my time to exploring a diverse range of fascinating topics within the field. My commitment to advancing computer vision and artificial intelligence remains steadfast, evident in my continued role as an active reviewer for top conferences. I am proud to have received recognition three times as an outstanding reviewer in ECCV 2020, CVPR 2021, and CVPR 2023.

With a heart full of ambition and an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I am enthusiastic about the impact I can make through my research and contributions to the technological landscape, especially in fostering the growth of Vision AI in Indonesia.

My research problem focuses on computer vision, computational photography, and image processing, which are as follows but not limited to:
- Stereo matching
- Light field depth estimation
- Light field synthesis
- Image enhancement
- GPGPU computation
- SLAM
- Face recognition
- Face anti-spoofing
- Deep fake detector
- License plate recognition
- License plate detection
- Image synthesis
